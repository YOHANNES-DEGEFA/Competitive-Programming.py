# You are given a permutation p1,p2,â€¦,pn.
# Then, an undirected graph is constructed in the following way: add an edge between vertices i, j such that i<j if and only if pi>pj.
# Your task is to count the number of connected components in this graph.
#
# Two vertices u and v belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at least one path along edges connecting u and v.
#
# A permutation is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order.

# For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
