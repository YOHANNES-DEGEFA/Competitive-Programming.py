# Monocarp is playing a computer game. In this game, his character fights different monsters.
#
# A fight between a character and a monster goes as follows.
# Suppose the character initially has health hC and attack dC; the monster initially has health hM and attack dM.
# The fight consists of several steps:
#
# the character attacks the monster, decreasing the monster's health by dC;
# the monster attacks the character, decreasing the character's health by dM;
# the character attacks the monster, decreasing the monster's health by dC;
# the monster attacks the character, decreasing the character's health by dM;
# and so on, until the end of the fight.
# The fight ends when someone's health becomes non-positive (i.â€‰e. 0 or less).
# If the monster's health becomes non-positive, the character wins, otherwise the monster wins.
#
# Monocarp's character currently has health equal to hC and attack equal to dC.
# He wants to slay a monster with health equal to hM and attack equal to dM.
# Before the fight, Monocarp can spend up to k coins to upgrade his character's weapon and/or armor;
# each upgrade costs exactly one coin, each weapon upgrade increases the character's attack by w,
# and each armor upgrade increases the character's health by a.
#
# Can Monocarp's character slay the monster if Monocarp spends coins on upgrades optimally?
