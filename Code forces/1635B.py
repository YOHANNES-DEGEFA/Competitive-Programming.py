# You are given an array a of size n.
#  Each element in this array is an integer between 1 and 109.
# You can perform several operations to this array.
#  During an operation, you can replace an element in the array with any integer between 1 and 109.
# Output the minimum number of operations needed such that the resulting array doesn't contain any local maximums, and the resulting array after the operations.
# An element ai is a local maximum if it is strictly larger than both of its neighbors (that is, ai>aiâˆ’1 and ai>ai+1).
#  Since a1 and an have only one neighbor each, they will never be a local maximum.
#
#
#
#  solution:
