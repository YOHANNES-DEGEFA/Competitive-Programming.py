# You are given an array a1,a2,â€¦,an, consisting of n integers. You are also given an integer value x.
#
# Let f(k) be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of a after applying the following operation:
# add x to the elements on exactly k distinct positions. An empty subarray should also be considered, it has sum 0.
#
# Note that the subarray doesn't have to include all of the increased elements.
#
# Calculate the maximum value of f(k) for all k from 0 to n independently.

# solution:

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):

    array = list(map(int, input().split()))

    max_sum_of_length=[float("-inf")]*(n+1)
